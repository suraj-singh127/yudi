# Problem Statement: Open-Source Threat Intelligence Platform

## Refined Problem Statement
Organizations need an **open-source tool** to **investigate threat intelligence data** from multiple sources and feeds. This tool should function as an **open-source scraper or search engine** that ingests **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** and provides:

- **Filtering options** to refine threat data.
- **Correlation of different IOC types** to identify attack patterns.
- **Visualization & reporting** to analyze security threats effectively.

## Key Steps in Development
### 1. Data Ingestion
- Pull IOCs from open-source threat intelligence feeds (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, etc.).
- Support manual uploads (CSV, JSON, STIX).
- Handle API-based IOC submissions.

### 2. Data Processing & Normalization
- Deduplicate and structure incoming IOC data.
- Enrich data using external APIs (WHOIS, PassiveDNS).
- Store IOCs in a structured format.

### 3. Search & Filteringimport aiohttp
- Implement **Elasticsearch** for fast IOC queries.
- Allow filtering based on IOC type, severity, source, and date.

### 4. Correlation & Relationship Mapping
- Use **graph-based analysis (Neo4j)** to find connections between IOCs.
- Identify IPs linked to domains, hashes tied to malware, and attack chains.

### 5. Visualization & Reporting
- Provide an interactive **dashboard** for searching & filtering IOCs.
- Display **relationship graphs** of IOC connections.
- Generate **reports in JSON, CSV, PDF formats**.

### 6. Automation & Alerting
- Send alerts when a **high-risk IOC** is detected.
- Integrate with **SIEM platforms** and send notifications via email, Slack, etc.

## Potential Enhancements & Features
- **Machine Learning for Threat Prediction**
- **Threat Scoring System for IOCs**
- **Community-driven IOC Submission & Voting**
- **SIEM & SOAR Integrations**
- **IOC False-Positive Reduction Using Historical Data**

# System Design for Threat Intelligence Platform

## 1. High-Level Architecture
### Main Components
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - Fetches IOCs from multiple feeds.
   - Supports **APIs, web scraping, manual uploads**.

2. **Data Processing & Normalization**
   - Deduplicates and structures data.
   - Uses external intelligence sources for enrichment.

3. **Storage Layer**
   - **Elasticsearch** for fast search.
   - **Neo4j** for IOC relationships.
   - **MongoDB/PostgreSQL** for metadata storage.

4. **Filtering & Search API**
   - Provides **fast IOC querying** and filtering options.

5. **Correlation Engine**
   - Identifies **relationships** between different IOCs.
   - Uses **graph-based analysis (Neo4j)**.

6. **Web Dashboard (UI/Frontend)**
   - Allows searching, filtering, and graph-based IOC visualization.

7. **Alerting System**
   - Sends alerts when a **high-risk IOC** is ingested.
   - Integrates with **SIEM tools**.

## 2. Technology Stack
### Backend
- **Python (FastAPI/Flask)** – API development
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka** – Async message processing
- **Neo4j** – Graph database for IOC relationships
- **Elasticsearch** – Fast searching
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL** – Metadata storage
- **Redis** – Caching for quick lookups
- **Docker & Kubernetes** – Deployment & scaling

### Frontend
- **React.js / Next.js** – Web dashboard
- **D3.js** – IOC graph visualization

### Infrastructure
- **AWS/GCP/Azure** – Cloud hosting
- **Kubernetes** – Microservices orchestration
- **Prometheus & Grafana** – Monitoring

## 3. System Workflow
### Step 1: Ingest Data
- Fetch IOCs from **threat intelligence feeds**.
- Push IOCs into **Kafka/RabbitMQ** for processing.

### Step 2: Process & Normalize Data
- Deduplicate & enrich IOC data.
- Store structured data in **MongoDB & Neo4j**.

### Step 3: Search & Filter
- Users can search/filter IOCs via **Elasticsearch**.

### Step 4: Correlation & Analysis
- The **Neo4j graph engine** maps IOC relationships.

### Step 5: Visualization & Reports
- Users view data in a **dashboard** and **generate reports**.

### Step 6: Alerting & Automation
- The system sends **alerts** for high-risk IOCs.
- Integrates with **SIEM tools (Splunk, TheHive, etc.)**.

## 4. Scalability & Performance
### Scalability Enhancements
- **Kafka/RabbitMQ** for async ingestion
- **Elasticsearch clusters** for high-speed search
- **Kubernetes for auto-scaling**

### Performance Optimizations
- **Redis caching** for frequent IOC lookups
- **Optimized DB indexing** for fast queries

## 5. Additional Features That Can Be Added
- **AI-powered Threat Detection**
- **Threat Intelligence Sharing API**
- **Real-time IOC Trend Analysis**
- **Integration with Threat Exchange Platforms**
