docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-wolfi:8.17.3

fetch the image id of the above image - [image_id]

sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144 - for troubleshooting due to max virtual memory area 65530 is too low we need to increase its max limit

docker run --name es3 -p 9200:9200 -it -m 2GB -e "xpack.ml.use_auto_machine_memory_percent=true" [image_id] #insert the image id fetched above

Now the container runs and throws out an enrollment token, default password and CA CERT 256 fingerprint

Now these things can also be generated once the elasticsearch container starts running 

docker cp es01:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs/http_ca.crt etc/share/elasticsearch/config/certs # for copying the ca cert from the running container 

Now you can check connectivity to the elasticsearch container by using the ca cert 

Fetching the container id using the container name used int the run command

docker ps --filter "name=es3" --format "{{.ID}}" # gives out the container id can use this container id to fetch the logs of running elastic search container
and then grep the elastic search password and enrollment token

docker exec -it es3 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic - for resetting the password

Note down the new password and copy it to the .env file in your python app
